      "reference_answer": "No, the company is managing its CAPEX and Fixed Assets pretty efficiently, which is evident from below key metrics:\nCAPEX/Revenue Ratio: 5.1%\nFixed assets/Total Assets: 20%\nReturn on Assets= 12.4%",
      "generated_answer": "According to 3M's FY2022 financial report, the company had:\n\n* Total assets: $35.3 billion\n* Total equity: $29.5 billion\n* Total debt: $5.5 billion\n\nBased on these numbers, 3M's debt-to-equity ratio is approximately 0.19, which is relatively low. This suggests that 3M is not overly leveraged and has a significant amount of equity to absorb any unexpected expenses or revenue shortfalls.\n\nIn terms of capital intensity, 3M's business model is not as capital-intensive as some other companies in the industrial or manufacturing sectors. This is because 3M generates significant revenue from a diverse range of products, including consumer goods, industrial, healthcare, and electronics. Additionally, the company has a strong track record of innovation and has been able to maintain a relatively low cost structure.\n\nThat being said, 3M does invest in research and development, which can be a significant expense. However, the company's revenue growth and profitability have been driven by a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, which have helped to offset these costs.\n\nOverall, while 3M is not a low-capital business, it is not excessively capital-intensive either.

      "generated_answer": "As of FY2022, 3M reported a net operating margin of 24.6% and a gross margin of 43.9%.\n\nAccording to 3M's annual report, the operating margin increased from 22.2% in FY2021 to 24.6% in FY2022. The main driver of this increase was the improvement in gross margin, which rose from 42.9% in FY2021 to 43.9% in FY2022. This increase in gross margin was driven by the company's efforts to optimize its supply chain, reduce costs, and increase pricing power.\n\nAs for whether operating margin is a useful metric for a company like 3M, it can be a useful metric in certain contexts. However, it may not be the most useful metric for several reasons:\n\n1. **It doesn't capture all costs**: Operating margin only looks at the difference between revenue and operating expenses, and does not account for other costs such as interest expenses, taxes, and capital expenditures.\n2. **It may not reflect underlying business performance**: Operating margin can be influenced by one-time events, such as changes in accounting policies or significant write-offs, which can distort the picture of the company's underlying business performance.\n3. **",
