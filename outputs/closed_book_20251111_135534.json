      "generated_answer": "To determine if 3M is a capital-intensive business based on fiscal year 2022 data, we would typically look at metrics such as the ratio of total assets to sales or total equity, the amount of fixed assets relative to operating income, and the capital expenditures as a percentage of sales.\n\nAs of my last update, without specific financial data from 3M's 10-K report for FY2022, I cannot provide exact figures. However, generally, companies in industries like manufacturing, construction, and heavy machinery tend to be more capital-intensive due to the need for significant investments in equipment, property, and infrastructure.\n\n3M is known for its diversified product portfolio which includes adhesives, safety products, medical devices, and electronics. Given this broad range and the nature of many of its products, it could reasonably be considered moderately capital-intensive compared to purely service-based companies. For precise analysis, you should review 3M\u2019s latest annual report and financial statements.",

However, generally speaking, factors that can drive changes in operating margins include:\n\n1. **Revenue Growth**: Increase in sales can improve margins if cost increases are controlled.\n2. **Cost Control**: Effective management of raw materials, labor, and overhead costs.\n3. **Product Mix**: Changes in the mix of high-margin versus low-margin products sold.\n4. **Operational Efficiency**: Improvements in manufacturing processes, supply chain management, and other operational efficiencies.\n5. **Acquisitions and Disposals**: The impact of any recent acquisitions or divestitures on overall margins.\n6. **Taxation**: Changes in tax laws or rates can affect reported margins.\n\nIf operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like 3M, it could be due to several reasons:\n- **Diverse Product Portfolio**: 3M operates across multiple industries with different profit margins, making operating margin less indicative of overall performance.\n- **Research and Development Intensity**: High investment in R&D can lead to lower short-term margins",
